# mlPlayground

My particular Machine Learning Playground, used to explore some techniques for regression and classification, mainly focused on using Deep Learning techniques.

### Datasets:

- [UCI Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/datasets)
- [NASA](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa)
- [NOAA](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/datasets)
- [Berkeley Earth](https://www.kaggle.com/nycparks/datasets)
- [NYC Parks & Recreation](https://www.kaggle.com/nycparks/datasets)

### Willing to play with:

- [ ] Image Recognition
  - [x] Digit Recognizer
  - [ ] Face Recognizer
  - [ ] Emotion Recognizer
  - [ ] Image Captioning
- [ ] Language Translation
- [ ] Speech Recognition



### Dependencies

- [Tensor Flow](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)
